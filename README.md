##  About Me

I'm a **solo game developer** passionate about building immersive, story-driven, and visually engaging experiences.  
My main focus is **Unreal Engine**, though I also work hands-on with **Unity**, exploring the creative and technical sides of interactive media.

I’m constantly experimenting and learning — diving into new tools, workflows, and creative extensions to expand my craft.  
Some of the tools I regularly use include:

- **Engines:** Unreal Engine, Unity  
- **3D / VFX:** Blender, Houdini  
- **Design & Art:** Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Substance, Illustrator, etc.)  
- **Editing & Grading:** DaVinci Resolve  
- **Other Tools:** various plug-ins, asset packs, and procedural toolchains for faster prototyping and better visuals
